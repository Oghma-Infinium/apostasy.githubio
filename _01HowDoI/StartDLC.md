Apostasy adjusts the level and starting requirements for Skyrim's Vanilla DLC quest lines in order to prevent (or otherwise discourage) the player from jumping head-first into content that may be too difficult for them due to differences in the way Apostasy is scaled vs the Vanilla game. Below are the detailed changes made to the Vanilla DLC questline starting conditions.

## How to Start Dawnguard

Apostasy adjusts Dawnguard's [Hall of the Vigilant](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hall_of_the_Vigilant) event, City Guard commentary, and the [Durak](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Durak) encounter from the vanilla level 10 to level 20. Dawnguard can still be started at any point by heading to [Dayspring Canyon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dayspring_Canyon).

It is recommended that the player is at least level 15 when attempting to start Dawnguard due to the increased threat that Vampires pose within the list.

## How to Start Hearthfires

Apostasy adjusts Hearthfire's [Letter from the Jarl](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Letter_from_Jarl_(Jarl%27s_Name)_of_(Jarl%27s_City)) from the vanilla level 9 to level 15.

## How to Start Dragonborn

Apostasy adjusts Dragonborn's [Cultist encounter](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragonborn_(quest)) to add a minimum level requirement of level 30. In order to begin the Dragonborn questline the player must be level 30 and have completed [The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Horn_of_Jurgen_Windcaller).
