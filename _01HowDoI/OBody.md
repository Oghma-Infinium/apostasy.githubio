Apostasy utilizes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBody Next Generation</a>  to provide a wider array of body types to the citizens of Skyrim and to allow the player to more easily swap between their preferred bodyslide presets without needing to fully rebuild the modlist's Bodyslide Output.

While the vanilla weight slider will affect the appearance of a given bodyslide, while in the RaceMenu it will only affect the neck, wrist, and ankle regions due to the player being defaulted to a `Zeroed Slider` bodyslide. In order to change the player's bodyslide, follow the directions below:  
 1. Go to a room without other NPCs, otherwise you may edit the wrong actor.  
 2. Open the OBody menu with `;`.  
     > .If the `;` key does not open the menu, then rebind the key to something else in the OBody MCM.  
 3. Select a new bodyslide preset from the menu.
