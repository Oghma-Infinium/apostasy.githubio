Apostasy utilizes [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307) for its Alternate Start which completely reworks the Vanilla intro and allows Helgen to exist as a functioning city prior to the events of the Main Quest.  

In order to start the main quest line follow the instructions below:  
 1. Go to The Restless Pilgrim, the Inn in Helgen.
 2. Speak to the Innkeeper, Matlara, and select the dialogue option **"Give me your best room. (X gold) (Start Intro)"**. 
 3. Go into the room on your right (if facing the bar) and go to sleep. This will kick off the Alternate Vanilla Start.

{: .warning}
If you encountered the **"Failed to start Dialogue Quest"** error in the start room, you will be unable to start the Main Quest due to the scripts governing the Alternate Start breaking. You can read more about this issue [here](/#when-starting-a-new-character).
