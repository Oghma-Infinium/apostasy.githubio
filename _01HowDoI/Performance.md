Apostasy is provided "as-is" with no warranties that it will have good performance on your machine regardless of the system specifications. Apostasy offers some addons that can potentially benefit the performance of the list, however these addons can only do so much to compensate for weaker systems. A "Lite" version of the list is not planned.

{: .hint}
Make sure to set your CPU Affinity *before* experimenting with other Performance Optimizations below.

## Setting CPU Affinity

In Mod Organizer 2, Click the `Puzzle Piece` button.

Select `Set CPU Affinity` from the dropdown.

That's it, it's really that simple. **Please, please, please** do this before launching the game and whenever you update the modlist.

## Frame Generation & Upscaling

Apostasy offers [ENB Frame Generation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144507) as an optional mod, which is compatible with GPUs that support DirectX 12 and a 120hz+ monitor. 

Beyond the nexus versions of ENB-compatible framegen, there is also [Skyrim Upscaler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80343) (nexus version does not work with ENB) and Lossless Scaling. These tools are considered **unsupported list modifications**. There are additional tweaks required to make these tools work properly, they will not be covered in this guide.
