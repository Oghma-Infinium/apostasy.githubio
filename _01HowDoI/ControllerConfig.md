Apostasy ships with a premade controller configuration designed for the list. These instructions are provided "as-is".

## Setting Up the Layout

 1. Navigate to the `Keybinds and Gamepad` separator under the `Optional Addons` section in the **left pane** of Apostasy's Mod Organizer 2.

 2. Deactivate the `Apostasy - Default Controlmap` mod, this mod contains Apostasy's stock keyboard and mouse setup.
 3. Activate the `Wait Menu Redirected` mod.
 4. Activate the `Apostasy - Controller Configuration` mod.

 5. Your separator should now look like the image above and your controller should work properly.

**Notes**:
 - By default, the controller config does not support blocking while wielding a spell in the off-hand. If you want to add this feature then you can change the **Dual Wield Blocking** keybind, however there is not an available bind for it on a standard controller.
