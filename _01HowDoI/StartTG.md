Apostasy utilizes [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) to adjust the progression and requirements for joining the [Thieves Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)).

Unlike in the Vanilla game, [Brynjolf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brynjolf) will no longer approach or speak to the Player on their first visit to [Riften](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Riften), unless they meet some specific requirements. Some of the [Thieves Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)) also have additional skill and progression requirements in an effort to slow the questline down to a more reasonable pace and encourage the player to engage more with the jobs.

Below is the list of quests that are affected by Apostasy's changes to the Thieves Guild:

 1. [A Chance Arrangement](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Chance_Arrangement): Requires the player to have an apprentice level Sneak skill (25 or higher), have picked at least 10 pockets, and stolen at least 100 items.
    > These stats can be checked in the **General Stats** > **Crime** tab of the Journal.
 1. [Loud and Clear](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Loud_and_Clear): Requires the player to have completed a minimum of 4 radiant jobs for the [Thieves Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)).
 1. [Dampened Spirits](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dampened_Spirits): Requires the player to have completed a minimum of 6 radiant jobs for the [Thieves Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)).
