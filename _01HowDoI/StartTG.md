Apostasy utilizes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thieves Guild Requirements</a> to adjust the progression and requirements for joining the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thieves Guild</a>.

Unlike in the Vanilla game, <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brynjolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brynjolf</a> will no longer approach or speak to the Player on their first visit to <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Riften" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riften</a>, unless they meet some specific requirements. Some of the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thieves Guild</a> also have additional skill and progression requirements in an effort to slow the questline down to a more reasonable pace and encourage the player to engage more with the jobs.

Below is the list of quests that are affected by Apostasy's changes to the Thieves Guild:

 1. <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Chance_Arrangement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Chance Arrangement</a>: Requires the player to have an apprentice level Sneak skill (25 or higher), have picked at least 10 pockets, and stolen at least 100 items.  
    > These stats can be checked in the **General Stats** > **Crime** tab of the Journal.
 1. <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Loud_and_Clear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loud and Clear</a>: Requires the player to have completed a minimum of 4 radiant jobs for the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thieves Guild</a>.
 1. <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dampened_Spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dampened Spirits</a>: Requires the player to have completed a minimum of 6 radiant jobs for the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thieves_Guild_(faction)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thieves Guild</a>.
