Apostasy's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immersive Equipment Displays</a> Preset includes displays for quest items, such as the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Quest_Items#Glenmoril_Witch_Head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glenmoril Witch Head</a>, however some players may not want to see these items displayed at all times, especially due to quest items being inventory bound until their associated quest(s) are completed.  

In order to remove these items follow the steps below:  
 1. Open the IED GUI with `Shift + Backspace`.  
 2. Under the `Display Manager` tab, navigate to `View > Custom Items`.    
 3. Look for the slot of the item that you want to remove (e.g., `Quest - Left Skull`).  
 4. Scroll down to `Equipment overrides` and expand the name of the item you want to remove (e.g., `Glenmoril Witch Head`).  
 5. Under `General`, tick the box next to `Disabled`.
