## Creating Viable Characters

Apostasy's design strives to make all builds feel viable and powerful overtime. While some builds will certainly pull ahead of others in the mid-game and late game, the vast majority of builds will be viable at all stages of play. 

When creating strong character builds, itâ€™s important not only to look for synergies with gear, items, and abilities you encounter during a playthrough, but also to maintain focus and avoid spreading yourself too thin. A good rule of thumb to follow is - one primary offensive skill, one primary armor skill, three supporting skills. 

While Stealth-based builds are viable and very strong in the end game, they are not recommended for beginners due to their early game struggles. Additionally, spellsword and battlemage builds may be more difficult to optimize for newer players 

For some more guidance on builds and examples, you can view the Class Guides section of the Wiki.
