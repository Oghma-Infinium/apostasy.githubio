## THERE IS NO TL;DR

**Reading isn't optional!** We provide a detailed wiki which answers a lot of questions in detail. At a minimum, the [Recommended Reading](/02RecommendedReading/Introduction.md) section should be read.  

This wiki contains extensive modlist documentation relating to changes from the vanilla game, new mechanics, and various issues you may encounter during your playthrough(s).

Some notable shortcuts:
 - The current [modlist](/06ModlistVersions/LoadOrder)
 - [Changelogs and Version History](/06ModlistVersions/CHANGELOG)
 - [Known Issues and Workarounds](/01Support/Known%20Issues)
 - [FAQs](/01Support/FAQs)

Support asks that you search the wiki and [discord server](https://discord.gg/4WwqfK5yHg) before asking any questions.

For web users you can search by entering your criteria into the search bar at the top of the page.
